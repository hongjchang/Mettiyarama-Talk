- A note for myself (or developers) about **committing files with >100MB to GitHub**:
    - Based on https://git-lfs.github.com/ :
    - In VSCode git terminal,
        1. `git lfs install`
        2. `git lfs track "*.mp4"` where mp4 is the extension of the large file.
        3. `git add .gitattributes`
        4. Just commit and PUSH like normal.
    - Or include git lfs when installing git on computer. Then, no need steps above already.
