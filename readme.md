**Notes:**
1. The `src` directory are adapted from the targeted source. So all copyrights subjected to the source(s) referenced.
2. Version histories are equivalent to the commit number, i.e. `Commit1` = `v1.0` etc.
3. All external references (including HTML online references) are included in the `index.html` file.

**Disclaimer:** This repository and the web page are created as purpose like mentioned in 'Main Purpose' above. No copyrights gained from the owner/source but my intention is to share the Buddhist talks with others (whose interested) as well as promoting the organiser of the talk sessions.

**TL;DR:**
- A note for myself (or developers) about **committing files with >100MB to GitHub**:
    - Based on https://git-lfs.github.com/ :
    - In VSCode git terminal,
    1. `git lfs install`
    2. `git lfs track "*.mp4"` where mp4 is the extension of the large file.
    3. `git add .gitattributes`
    4. Just commit and PUSH like normal.
    - Or include git lfs when installing git on computer. Then, no need steps above already.
